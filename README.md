# QuadZap - trouble times four

Pure CSS3 game written with TypeScript.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:oeriks/quadzap.git
cd quadzap
npm install
```

## Running the server

Run these two commands in separate terminal windows
```
node app.js
grunt watch
```

The first one starts the Node/Express server, the second is, among other things, watching for changes in .scss-files and compiles them.
